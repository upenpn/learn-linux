**Reference and Explanation:**

- **Symbolic Links:** These are special types of files that act as shortcuts or references to other files or directories in the file system. When using `pwd -P`, symbolic links are resolved to show the actual path instead of the link itself.

- **Recursively (`-r` option):** This means performing an operation on a target and all of its contents, including subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, and so on. For example, `rm -r dir` will delete the directory "dir" and all its contents.

- **Detailed Information (`-l` option):** When using `ls -l`, you get a detailed listing of files and directories, including permissions, owner, size, and modification date.

- **Forcefully (`-f` option):** This option, used with `rm -f`, forces the removal of a file without prompting for confirmation, which can be useful in scripting or automation tasks.

- **Prompt Before Overwriting (`-i` option):** When using `cp -i`, a prompt appears before overwriting an existing file, helping to prevent accidental data loss.
